## Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an IoT-based Environmental Monitoring System. The project aims to address the rising concern of air pollution in urban areas by providing a real-time monitoring system that detects various pollutants and alerts users about potential risks. The system utilizes microcontrollers and MQ gas sensors to measure gas concentrations, and it is integrated with the Wazigate platform for cloud connectivity.


## Overview

The IoT Environmental Monitoring System is designed to monitor air pollution levels in urban areas and provide real-time data to users through a web-based dashboard. The system uses various MQ gas sensors to detect pollutants such as LPG, smoke, CO2, NH4, CO, and CH4. It is integrated with the Wazigate platform to enable cloud connectivity and remote monitoring.

## Features
    
    - Real-time monitoring of air pollution levels
    - Customizable alerts and notifications for pollutant thresholds
    - Historical data logging for trend analysis
    - Integration with Wazigate for cloud connectivity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    - Arduino Pro Mini board
    - MQ2, MQ4, MQ135, and MQ7 gas sensors
    - Wazigate platform account

### Installation

    1. Connect the gas sensors to the Arduino Pro Mini board as specified in the schematic.
    2. Upload the code to the Arduino Pro Mini using the Arduino IDE.
    3. Set up a Wazigate account and obtain the necessary credentials for cloud connectivity.

## Usage

    1. Power on the Environmental Monitoring System.
    2. The system will start monitoring air pollution levels and displaying data on the connected dashboard.
    3. Receive alerts and notifications when pollutant thresholds are exceeded.
    4. Access historical data on the dashboard for trend analysis.
